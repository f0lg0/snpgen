A Simple Node Project Generator based on my [node-webapp-template](https://github.com/f0lg0/node-webapp-template) for beginners.

## DISCLAIMER

The Javascript version is under development. It will be also more complex than the Python one.

## Description

This is an offline project generator that let's you create NodeJS projects by simply running a command. This is useful especially when you don't have the possibility to clone my [template](https://github.com/f0lg0/node-webapp-template). It is also **customizable** so you can build your own template and generate your own project.

### Documentation

Coming soon.

### Run

PYTHON VERSION

```
python3 generate.py
```

Just run this file and you will be go to go, it even installs all the depndencies from the package.json file.

The project template is taken from the template file, there you will find all the files and their relative content.

Have fun with it and customize it as you like! If you tweak it, it can be used to generate other projects too!

### Note

The files are one-line pieces of code, you may want to beautify them.
